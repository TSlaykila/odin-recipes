        2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste<br>
        2 cans (6.5 ounces each) tomato sauce<br>
        1/2 cup water<br>
        2 tablespoons white sugar<br>
        1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves<br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
        2 cups ricotta cheese<br>
        1 egg <br>
        3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese <br>
        3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>
        Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)<br>
        </p>
    
    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <p> <strong>Preheat Oven: </strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).<br>

        <strong>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water.<br>
        
        <strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce: </strong>In a large skillet or saucepan, cook ground beef or sausage over medium heat until browned. Add chopped onion and minced garlic; cook until onion is tender. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br>
        
        <strong>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:</strong>  In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with beaten egg and 1/2 teaspoon salt. <br>
        
        <strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong> Spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 3 cooked lasagna noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, ending with the remaining meat sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese.<br>
        
        <strong>Cover with foil:</strong>  to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. <br>
        
        <strong>Bake in preheated oven:</strong> 25 minutes.</p>

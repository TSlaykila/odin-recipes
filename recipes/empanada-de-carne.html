<h2>Recipe's Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
    1/2 teaspoon salt <br>
    1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes <br>
    1/4 cup cold water <br>
    1 tablespoon olive oil <br>
    1 onion, finely chopped <br>
    2 cloves garlic, minced <br>
    1 pound (450g) ground beef <br>
    1 teaspoon ground cumin <br>
    1 teaspoon paprika <br>
    1/2 teaspoon dried oregano <br>
    Salt and pepper, to taste <br>
    1/2 cup green olives, sliced (optional) <br>
    2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped (optional) <br>
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add cold water, tossing with a fork until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. <br>

    <strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until softened. Add garlic and cook for another minute. Add ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned. Drain excess fat. Stir in cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat and let cool. <br>

    <strong>Assemble the Empanadas:</strong> Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). On a floured surface, roll out dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out rounds using a 5-inch cookie cutter or a small bowl. Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each round. Add olives and eggs if desired. Fold dough over filling to create a half-moon shape. Press edges together and crimp with a fork to seal. <br>

    <strong>Bake:</strong> Place empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush tops with beaten egg for a shiny finish, if desired. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve warm and enjoy! <br>

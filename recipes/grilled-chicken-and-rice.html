<h2>Recipe's Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts <br>
    1/4 cup olive oil <br>
    2 tablespoons lemon juice <br>
    2 cloves garlic, minced <br>
    1 teaspoon dried oregano <br>
    1 teaspoon dried thyme <br>
    1/2 teaspoon paprika <br>
    Salt and pepper, to taste <br>
    2 cups long-grain white rice <br>
    4 cups chicken broth <br>
    2 tablespoons butter <br>
    Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish) <br>
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag. Pour marinade over chicken, turning to coat evenly. Cover or seal and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best flavor. <br>

    <strong>Grill the Chicken:</strong> Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip off. Grill chicken for 6-8 minutes per side, or until juices run clear and internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Remove from grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing. <br>

    <strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong> While chicken is grilling, rinse rice under cold water until water runs clear. In a saucepan, bring chicken broth and butter to a boil. Stir in rice and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. Fluff rice with a fork. <br>

    <strong>Serve:</strong> Slice grilled chicken and serve over seasoned rice. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley. Enjoy your delicious grilled chicken and rice! <br>
